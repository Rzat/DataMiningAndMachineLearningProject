# DataMiningMachineLearninProject
The purpose of this project is to keep track and maintain the codebase for my semester project for DataMining_MachineLearning.

DMML Self Project Descriptor:
	So total I need to create 5 Machine Learning models for DMML Project,
	 1. 4 Supervised Model and 1 Unsupervised learning Model
		4 Supervised Learning Models which I will Create for this project are below:	
			a). 2 Regression Model with 1 dataset
							
			  Multiple or Polynomial
			  Random Forest Regression
								
			b). 2 Classification Model with 1 dataset 
			  KNN
			  Kernel SVM
				
		1 Unsupervised Learning Model i will create for this project.
            		a). K-Means Clustering
          
The above saidMachine learning algorithm might get changed as i progress.

Thanks
