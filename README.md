# DataMiningMachineLearninProject
The purpose of this project is to keep track of and maintain the codebase for my semester project for DataMining&MachineLearning.

DMML Self Project Descriptor:
	So total I need to create 5 Machine Learning models for DMML Project.
	 1. 5 Supervised Model
	 
		4 Supervised Learning Models which I will Create for this project are below:	
			a). 2 Regression Model with 1 dataset
							
			  Multiple Linear
			  Random Forest Regression
								
			b). 2 Classification Model with 1 dataset 
			  Decision Tree
			  Logistic Regession 
			  Naive Bayes
			
Dataset has been taken from the open-source, and all the dataset credit goes to the original author.


Thanks
